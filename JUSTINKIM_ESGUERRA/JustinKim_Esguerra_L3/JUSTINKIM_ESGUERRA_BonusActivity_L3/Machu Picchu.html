        <p><b>Machu Picchu</b> is a 15th-century Inca citadel located in the Eastern Cordillera of southern Peru on a 2,430-meter (7,970 ft) peak. It is situated on a 2,430-meter (7,970 ft) mountain ridge above the Sacred Valley, which is 80 kilometers (50 miles) northwest of Cusco and through which the Urubamba River flows. Most archaeologists believe that Machu Picchu was built as an estate for the Inca emperor Pachacuti (1438â€“1472). It is the most visited tourist attraction in Peru.</p>
