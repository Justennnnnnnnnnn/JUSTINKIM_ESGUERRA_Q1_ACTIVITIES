        <p><b>The Great Wall of China</b> is a series of fortifications that stretch across northern China, <mark>built to protect against invasions and raids</mark>. It is one of the most iconic structures in the world and a UNESCO World Heritage site. The wall was constructed over several dynasties, with the earliest sections dating back to the 7th century BC. The most famous sections were built during the Ming Dynasty (1368â€“1644). The wall spans approximately 13,170 miles (21,196 kilometers) and includes walls, trenches, and natural barriers such as hills and rivers.</p>
