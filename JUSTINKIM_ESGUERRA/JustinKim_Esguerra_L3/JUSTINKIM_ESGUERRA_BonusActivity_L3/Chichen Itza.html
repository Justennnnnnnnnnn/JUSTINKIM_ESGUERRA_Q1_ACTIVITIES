        <p><b>Chichén Itzá</b> (often spelled Chichen Itza in English and traditional Yucatec <br> Maya) Yucatec  Maya pronunciation was a large pre-Columbian city built by <br>the Maya people of the Terminal Classic period. The archeological site is located <br>in Tinúm Municipality, Yucatán State, Mexico.[1]

Chichén Itzá was a major focal <br>point in the Northern Maya Lowlands from the Late Classic (c. AD 600–900)<br> through the Terminal Classic (c. AD 800–900) and into the early portion of the <br>Postclassic period (c. AD 900–1200). The site exhibits a multitude of architectural<br> styles, reminiscent of styles seen in central Mexico and of the Puuc and Chenes <br>styles of the Northern Maya lowlands. The presence of central Mexican styles was<br> once thought to have been representative of direct migration or even conquest from <br>central Mexico, but most contemporary interpretations view the presence of these <br>non-Maya styles more as the result of cultural diffusion.

Chichén Itzá was one of <br> the largest Maya cities and it was likely to have been one of the mythical great <br>cities, or Tollans, referred to in later Mesoamerican literature.[2] The city may have <br>had the most diverse population in the Maya world, a factor that could have <br>contributed to the variety of architectural styles at the site.[3]

The ruins of <u>Chichén Itzá</u><br> are federal property, and the site's stewardship is maintained by Mexico's Instituto <br>Nacional de Antropología e Historia (National Institute of Anthropology and History). <br>The land under the monuments had been privately owned until 29 March 2010, when it <br>was purchased by the state of Yucatán.[nb 2]

Chichén Itzá is one of the most visited<br> archeological sites in Mexico with over 2.6 million tourists in 2017.[4</p>
